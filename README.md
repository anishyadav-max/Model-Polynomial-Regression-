# Model-Polynomial-Regression-
Polynomial Regression fits a curve to the data instead of a straight line, providing a more flexible model for complex patterns.

Polynomial Regression (Degree 2 and 3) is a powerful technique used when the data exhibits a non-linear relationship. By setting the degree of the polynomial to 2 or 3, this model can effectively capture curved patterns without introducing excessive complexity.

Degree 2 (Quadratic): The model fits a parabola to the data, allowing it to handle U-shaped trends. This is useful when the relationship between the independent and dependent variables follows a simple curve.

Degree 3 (Cubic): The cubic model adds more flexibility, allowing for an S-shaped curve or changes in the direction of the trend. This degree is suitable for more complex patterns but still avoids the risk of overfitting that higher-degree polynomials might cause.

Both degree 2 and degree 3 models provide a good balance between capturing non-linearity and maintaining a relatively simple model, making them ideal choices when you need to model data that is not well represented by a straight line.
